# Python
Here I'll be posting small python code that I've found in textbooks or online.

# Dice Roller 
- This program asks the user what type of dice they want to roll and then outputs the result.

# Formatted Name
- This program asks the user for their first and last name. We then take that information and call the get_formatted_name
  which will return the users name in proper the proper format.
  
# Greet User
 - This program uses json. There are three different functions in this program. The main function, greet_user, will check to see if this
   is a returning user. If not we ask for their username and store it.
   
 # Fizz Buzz
- A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples 
  of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
