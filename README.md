# Python
Here I'll be posting smaller python projects that I've found in textbooks or online.

# Dice Roller 
- This program asks the user what type of dice they want to roll and then outputs the result.

# Formatted Name
- This program asks the user for their first and last name. We then take that information and call the get_formatted_name
  which will return the users name in proper the proper format.
  
# Greet User
 - This program uses json. There are three different functions in this program. The main function, greet_user, will check to see if this
   is a returning user. If not we ask for their username and store it.
